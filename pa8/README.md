This repository contains the implementation of a Dictionary ADT implemented in C++ that is implemented as a Red Black tree with nodes. It has two client files: WordFrequency and Order, both implemented in C++.


Dictionary.cpp Written by you, the majority of work for this project

Order.cpp: Client for this project designed to take in a stream of words, construct a dictionary, then output the dictionary traversed in order and pre order.

WordFrequency.cpp: Client for this project designed to take in a stream of words, construct a dictionary, then output the frequency of the words.

Dictionary.h: Header file for a C++ program that implements a Dictionary ADT. It contains constructors and destructors, as well as getters and setters.

DictionaryTest.c: A file containing function calls to methods in Dictionary.cpp to test each method's functionality.

Makefile: A makefile for easy compilation of the project. It defines rules for building the executable files from the source code

README.md: Simply a description of everything mentioned above.
